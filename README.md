# Arduino-Based Distance Measurement System

This project is a simple distance measurement system developed as part of the **Measurement and Instrumentation** course. It uses an Arduino Uno, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a TP223 capacitive touch sensor, and an I2C 16x2 LCD display to measure and display distances in real time.
