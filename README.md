# Arduino-Based Distance Measurement System

This project is a simple distance measurement system developed as part of the **Measurement and Instrumentation** course. It uses an Arduino Uno, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a TP223 capacitive touch sensor, and an I2C 16x2 LCD display to measure and display distances in real time.

## Working Principle

The TP223 capacitive touch sensor acts as an ON/OFF switch. When touched, it toggles the Arduino into an active measuring state. While active, the Arduino sends a pulse through the HC-SR04, which emits an ultrasonic wave. The time it takes for the echo to return is used to calculate distance using the formula:

```latex
\[
\text{Distance (cm)} = \frac{\text{Time (microseconds)} \times 0.0343}{2}
\]
